ML Project for Wild Code School. 

First big solo project in ML which includes usage of multiclass logistic regression, SVC classifiers, random forests and neural networks. 

Utilizes several ML metrics to assess results of predictions, utilizes multiple graphics to explain dependencies between parameters and predictions.

The one I am genuinely very proud of!
